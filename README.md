# SW5e-NPC-importer
A module for the FoundryVTT **SW5e - Fifth Edition System**. Easily import 5e monster and NPC statblocks into your game. As long as it's formatted using the standard WotC layout, it'll create a new actor with an NPC character sheet using those stats.

Open the character sheet for that new actor and you'll see all of the stats, actions, and spells filled out for you. Everything in the statblock should be represented on the character sheet, including legendary actions and reactions (which the Glabrezu doesn't have). To have the spells show up in the Spellbook requires having the "Spells (SRD)" compendium installed, which should come with the 5e system.


Here's the text if you want to try it yourself and don't have any statblocks handy.
